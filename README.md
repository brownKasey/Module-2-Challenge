# Module-2-Challenge

## Description

My goal with this project was to create a portfolio to use for my career in full stack devolopment. I started by writing the html, then once all of the html was written I started styling my webpage with css. 

I was able to style my webpage completely how i wanted it to look. However, once i started styling my webpage I ran into issues with the styling (mainly the navigation bar) that effects how my page layout will look on other devices. The navigation bar caused many issues because I wanted to challenge myself to create a navigation bar that was functional but also asthetically pleasing to myself. The boxes that contain each section of my webpage also caused issues because of how i had to mess with them to make them alternate what side of the screen they start at.

Although I ran into many issues, this was a fun project to work on. In the future, I will find solutions to the issues by either compromising on my design or by doing further research into how i can solve all the problems and subsequent problems that may be caused down the line.
